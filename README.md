# Product Info
Our system is simple in its premise. Users purchase digital shares of a product through our website. Each product has a designated "start time" which indicates when shares of the product will no longer be for sale. From there, the product listed is opened during a live video stream and the materials inside are distributed to the users who purchased shares based on various characteristics defined in the original product publishing to our site.

## Deployment Info
We are using Heroku for deployement which also contains our PostgreSQL database server.
